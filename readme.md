# rouguelike

## abstract

This is the final iteration of a small game I worked on over the span of 2 consecutive days, in an effort to familiarise myself with OOP. This game is played in Command Prompt.

## usage 

To try it, download all the files within this folder, make sure they're in the same file directory, and run `input.py`. Make sure you have Python3 or later versions installed!

## future

1. Failed to integrate bombs into the gameplay loop. The logic shouldn't be too difficult to implement, since the necromancer class has similar behaviour. However, **difficulty scaling** in this game is a big issue, and needs reworking.
2. Much of the code in `main.py` that could be compressed into functions were copied and pasted for easy reference. Code refactoring would have improved this.
3. Inability to print more than one bullet to the screen. Reworking the entity logging and printing system to a purely global coordinate-based dictionary that is updated by all entities per update, alongside a single print function, would have enabled multiple bullets to be printed.
4. Much of the HUD display for the user is hard coded. Refactoring them into functions for greater reusabilty would be ideal.

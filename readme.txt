Final iteration of a small game I worked on over the span of 2 consecutive days, to be played in command prompt. 
To try it, download all the files within this folder, make sure they're in the same file directory, and run 'input.py'. 
Make sure you have Python3 or later versions installed!

(Note: Didn't manage to integrate bombs into the gameplay loop. Will work on the logic for that and hopefully return
to this project when I have a bit more experience under my belt!)

-Gong :)
